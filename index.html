                Kazuma Kannagi was banished from his family for his inability to possess or control
                fire powers. Four years later, he returns with a new name: Kazuma Yagami. He is now
                more powerful
                than ever because he has since developed and perfected wind magic. Unfortunately
                for him, though,
                many Kannagi family members have been mysteriously murdered by another wind magic
                user, and the
                blame is falling on him. He now has to work with Ayano Kannagi, a hot-headed fire
                user who is
                set to be the next head of the Kannagi family, to clear his name. What happens when
                fire and
                wind collide?
